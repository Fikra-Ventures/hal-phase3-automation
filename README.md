## Quick Start

1. **Clone Repository**: `git clone https://github.com/fikra-hal/hal-phase3-automation.git`
2. **Setup Environment**: `./scripts/setup.sh`
3. **Start Automation**: `npm run start-automation`
4. **Monitor Progress**: Check #hal-phase3-automation Slack channel

## Success Metrics

- **Memory Management**: >95% context retention, >90% search accuracy, <500ms retrieval
- **Guardrails**: >99% violation detection, <2% false positives, <200ms latency
- **Performance**: <24h drift detection, >95% test coverage, 100% automation

## Run ZTR without secrets

The Zero-Touch Runner (ZTR) workflow supports running in mock mode when secrets are missing or not configured. This provides a safe, non-destructive way to test the workflow and understand its behavior.

### Testing Mock Mode

1. **Manual Trigger**: Go to [Actions](../../actions/workflows/provision-make.yml) and click "Run workflow"
   - Set **mode** to `mock` for explicit mock mode
   - Set **mode** to `auto` to auto-detect based on available secrets
   - Set **mode** to `provision` for actual provisioning (requires all secrets)

2. **View Results**:
   - Check the workflow run logs for detailed execution information
   - Download the `ztr-report` artifact containing execution reports
   - Review the auto-created "ZTR Run Summary" issue for a comprehensive overview

3. **Expected Behavior**:
   - Mock mode runs safely without requiring any secrets
   - Generates a detailed mock report showing what would have been done
   - Creates/updates a summary issue with execution details and checklist
   - Uploads artifacts for inspection and debugging

### Artifacts and Reports

After each ZTR run, you can find:
- **Artifacts**: Download from the workflow run page â†’ "Artifacts" section
- **Reports**: JSON files containing execution details, timestamps, and notes
- **Issues**: Auto-created/updated "ðŸ¤– ZTR Run Summary" issue with full details
- **Logs**: Complete workflow execution logs in the GitHub Actions interface

### Enabling Full Provisioning

To switch from mock to actual provisioning:
1. Configure all required secrets in [Repository Settings â†’ Secrets](../../settings/secrets/actions)
2. Required secrets: `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `AIRTABLE_API_KEY`, `AIRTABLE_BASE_ID`, `NOTION_API_KEY`, `ZAPIER_WEBHOOK_URL`
3. Run the workflow with mode set to `auto` or `provision`
